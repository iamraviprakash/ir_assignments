or the Viterbi algorithm, among other closely-related algorithms.

There are generalizations and combinations of these ideas in all sorts of directions.
E.g., an operations researcher might say that Markov decision problems
are "just" optimization problems with a particular structure and go off
to look at Lagrange multipliers and duality gaps.
