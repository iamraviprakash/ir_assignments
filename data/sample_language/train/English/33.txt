Depending again on whether you are interested in discrete- or continuous- time- or state-spaces, depending on what noise model you assume, and depending on which of these problems you want to solve (filtering, smoothing, trajectory estimation) you end up with e.g. the "forward algorithm" for hidden Markov models, the Kalman filter for linear systems,
